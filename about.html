<h2>About Ryomen Sukuna</h2>

<p>
<strong>Sukuna is known as the "King of Curses" </strong>and is considered the strongest cursed spirit in the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. 
More than a thousand years ago, during the Heian Era — known as the <strong>Golden Age of Jujutsu</strong> — Sukuna was originally a human sorcerer. 
However, his power was so immense and terrifying that after his death, he became a legendary cursed spirit.
</p>

<p>
Unlike ordinary curses, Sukuna possesses extreme intelligence, strategic thinking, and deep knowledge of cursed techniques. 
His presence alone causes fear among both sorcerers and curses. 
Even today, his power remains sealed within his twenty indestructible fingers, which are classified as special-grade cursed objects.
</p>

<p>
When Yuji Itadori consumes one of Sukuna’s fingers, Sukuna is reincarnated inside his body. 
Although trapped within Yuji, Sukuna constantly seeks opportunities to regain full control and return to his original form.
